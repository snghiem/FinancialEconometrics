Chapter 9 - Time series

```{r}
library("Ecdat")
library("fGarch")
library("evir")
library("forecast")
data(CRSPday, package="Ecdat")
data(bmw)
summary(bmw)
length(bmw)
```
```{r}
plot(bmw)
acf(bmw)
```

The data seems to be stationary in the plot diagram. The autocorrelation function plot shows a well-behaved data without significant autocorrelation (here all changes lie within the dotted lines).
```{r}
Box.test(x=bmw, lag=5, type="Ljung-Box")
```
The test gives a very small p-value, so I could reject the null hypothesis that the data is indipendenly distributed. There is serial correlation within the data.

So now 

```{r}
fitAR1 = arima(bmw, order = c(1,0,0))
?acf
```
